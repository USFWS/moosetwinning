## What is `moosetwinning`?

The `moosetwinning` package includes functions for importing moose twinning data and producing twinning rate estimates, plots and summary tables, and a MS Word report that follows the USFWS Refuge graphic standard. The package was originally developed for moose twinning surveys at [Tetlin National Wildlife Refuge](https://iris.fws.gov/APPS/ServCat/Reference/Profile/145850), but the functions are flexible and could be adapted for moose twinning surveys elsewhere. 


## What's required?

To use `moosetwinning` and generate reports, youâ€™ll need:

1.  **R version \>4.0** Available through FWS Apps-to-Go

2.  **Rtools version \>4.0** Available through FWS Apps-to-Go

3. A version of [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/) that includes [Quarto](https://quarto.org/)

To install `moosetwinning`:  

``` {r, eval=FALSE}
if (!require("pak")) install.packages("pak")  
pak::pak("USFWS/moosetwinning")  
library(moosetwinning)
```


## Help!

To find a help file for any function in `moosetwinning`, type `?` and the name of the function. For example, to get help on how to use the `import_format()` function, type `?import_format`. To learn about each function in the `moosetwinning` package, visit the [Reference](https://usfws.github.io/moosetwinning/reference/index.html) page and select a function (e.g., [`import_format`](https://usfws.github.io/moosetwinning/reference/import_format.html))

## How do I use it?  

There are two general approaches to using `moosetwinning` and selecting which approach to take depends on your needs. The first approach ("*step-wise*"), consists of using individual functions to work through the steps of importing and formatting input data, performing an analysis, and creating tables and plots. This approach would be favored if you're interested in examining the details of the analysis, would like to perform additional analyses not included in the package, or if you just want tables and figures. The second approach ("*all in one*") performs all the above steps and compiles the results into a MS Word document with `run_report()` function. This approach would be favored for annual reporting of results. Below are more details on the two approaches.


### Option 1: Creating figures and tables

#### Step 1: Import and format data using `import_format()`

The first step to using any functions in `moosetwinning` is to import and format data. This is done using the `import_format()` function, which takes in a CSV of data and returns a formatted R data frame. The function requires a file directory path to a CSV containing properly formatted data. The input CSV should following the standard described in [metadata](https://iris.fws.gov/APPS/ServCat/Reference/Profile/179584).

To use example data that follow the required standard:

``` {r, message=FALSE}
dat <- import_format(system.file("extdata", "dat.csv", 
                                 package = "moosetwinning"))
head(dat)
```


#### Step 2: Analysis

To estimate twinning rates using data have been imported and formatted using the `import_format()` function:

``` {r import-format, message=FALSE}
dat_sum <- twinning_rates(dat)
dat_sum
```


#### Step 3: Create summary tables and figures

You can create formatted `flextable` tables and figures for a report:

``` {r create-tbls, message=FALSE}
tbls <- create_tbls(dat)
```

``` {r tbl1, message=FALSE}
tbls$tbl1
```

``` {r tbl2, message=FALSE}
tbls$tbl2
```

You can also create summary plots:

``` {r create-figs, message=FALSE}
figs <- create_figs(dat)
```

``` {r fig2, message=FALSE}
figs$fig2
```

``` {r fig3, message=FALSE}
figs$fig3
```


### Option 2: Create a report

This is a function developed to generate a Quarto report that summarizes annual moose twinning results. It relies on many of the above functions for importing a CSV, formatting and analyzing the data, and generating tables and figures of the results. To generate a report, you need to provide a relative path to a CSV file containing moose twinning data following the required standard (see `?moose_twinning` for an example:

```{r create-report, eval = FALSE}
create_report(dat_in = "a_path/to/my_twinning_data.csv")
```

In addition to saving a MS Word doc report to your working directory, this function also creates a new directory (default name is `quarto`) in your working directory that contains the .qmd file used to render the report and other associated files, including bib files for the bibliography, a csl file for formatting the bibliography to the Journal of Wildlife Management standard, an images folder, and a MS Word doc file containing custom text styles that match the National Wildlife Refuge System graphic standard. All these files can be edited as needed, and the .qmd can be re-rendered directly to customize your report, as needed.
